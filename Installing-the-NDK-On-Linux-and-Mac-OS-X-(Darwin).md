##On Linux and Mac OS X (Darwin):
1. Open a terminal window.
1. Go to the directory to which you downloaded the package.
1. Run chmod a+x on the downloaded package.
1. Execute the package. For example:

   `ndk$ chmod a+x android-ndk-r10c-darwin-x86_64.bin`

   `ndk$ ./android-ndk-r10c-darwin-x86_64.bin`
          
The folder containing the NDK extracts itself.

Note that you can also use a program like 7z to extract the package.
